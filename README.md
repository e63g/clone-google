## Google clone website with search functionality

Google website done in pure HTML/CSS/JS for the exercise purpose.

Live: https://e63g.github.io/clone-google/images.html (it seems its not working perfect on GitHub Pages, works perfect locally)

This was my first use of HTTP methods and parameters like 'q='.
